This line `if: -> { new_record? || !password.nil? }` in User Model means - 

Explanation:
new_record?: This is a method provided by ActiveRecord that returns true if the object hasn't been saved to the database yet. In this context, it ensures that when creating a new user, the password must be present and valid.

!password.nil?: This checks if the password attribute is not nil. It's used here to ensure that when updating an existing user, the password validation only runs if a password has been provided (i.e., the user is attempting to change their password).
